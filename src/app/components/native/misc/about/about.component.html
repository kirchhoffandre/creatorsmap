        I love building and creating stuff; and would consider myself as a CREATOR. Some people might refer to it as a
        Maker, Builder, Developer or just simply someone who likes to take a problem and come up with a solution. I
        really enjoy the process of tinkering and making stuff instead of just consuming. Taking a problem, figuring
        out a solution to it and being able to translate just an idea into a minimal viable product is a huge
        satisfaction.
      </p>
      <p><a routerLink="/">CREATORSMAP</a> is just one of the many ideas where I can see huge value in connecting
        like-minded people. Bringing people together with a shared interest and enabling them to collaborate is great!
